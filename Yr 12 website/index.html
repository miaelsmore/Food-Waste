        <h4>Why Should We Reduce Food Waste?</h4>
    <ul>
        <h3><p>Being overweight or having obesity are associated with increased risk of these health conditions, per the CDC, so weight loss can 
            be important if you have a high body mass index (BMI). Fortunately, following a high-quality diet in which you pay attention
            to portion sizes can also help you reach a healthy weight, according to the Mayo Clinic. Another piece 
            of the puzzle: eating mindfully. Stop eating when youâ€™re full, and don't eat too fast or for emotional reasons. Being able 
        to maintain a healthy diet throughout your whole life is a very important skill to have.</p></h3>
